# RFC 0005 - Sandbox Egress Middleware

## Summary

This RFC proposes the introduction of sandbox proxy egress middleware: a set of hooks that can inspect, transform, block, and annotate outbound sandbox requests at various steps of request processing flow. The feature described here establishes the initial support needed to validate the contract, policy integration, and operational model through early experiments; it is expected to evolve over time, and future extensions are called out throughout this RFC.

## Motivation

OpenShell already controls *where* a sandbox can connect. The supervisor enforces network policy on every outbound connection and only allows egress to approved endpoints. Today, that control stops at the destination: once a connection is allowed, the request can carry any payload. Network policy can decide whether a sandbox may talk to `api.openai.com`, but it cannot decide whether a particular request to `api.openai.com` should be allowed based on what that request contains.

Users have a need to control the content that leaves the sandbox. Agents routinely send prompts, tool arguments, uploaded files, which may contain sensitive information. Acting on that traffic, requires inspecting the request itself (e.g. redacting PII or secrets before they leave the sandbox, blocking requests that carry confidential documents, requiring sensitive content to be processed by a local model).

This RFC introduces egress middleware: hooks that run within the supervisor proxy flow and can inspect, transform, block, and annotate outbound requests based on their content. Rather than building a fixed set of content checks into OpenShell, the middleware contract lets operators process selected requests through trusted services that implement their own logic. OpenShell cannot embed every useful detection and transformation approach. We want to allow dedicated PII tools such as Presidio or NeMo Anonymizer, organization-specific classifiers, and experimental research scanners to be plugged in. A stable contract lets teams and researchers iterate on different implementations without changing OpenShell itself.

OpenShell may still ship first-party middleware for a small number of operations where it makes sense. First-party and third-party middleware share the same contract; the difference is only who builds and operates the service.

### Use-case: Privacy Guard

Privacy Guard is the motivating use case for this RFC. It is middleware that inspects outbound request content for sensitive data and applies a mitigation before the request leaves the sandbox. We use it throughout this document as a concrete example because it exercises every property the contract needs: policy-controlled placement in the proxy flow, an external service configuration, a request/response contract, failure behavior, and audit-safe findings.

Consider an agent configured with a cloud model. The operator wants uploaded images to never reach that model. With egress middleware, they configure Privacy Guard on requests bound for the model endpoint. When the agent uploads an image and asks the model about it, the middleware inspects the request content, detects the image, and redacts it -- replacing it with a placeholder (for example, `image upload is disabled for this model`) before the request leaves the sandbox.

Beyond redaction, middleware also produces structured findings and metadata about a request. This metadata is intended to be stable enough for a future model router to consume - for example, to route sensitive requests to a local model instead.

## Non-goals

- **Model routing.** This RFC defines the metadata that middleware emits, but not the component that consumes it to pick a model. Routing a request to a different model based on findings is a separate concern tracked in [#1734](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/issues/1734). Here we only ensure the metadata contract is stable enough for a future router to build on.
- **A general-purpose middleware framework.** The first version targets outbound request processing in the supervisor proxy flow. It is not an arbitrary plugin system for every extension point in OpenShell, and it does not cover response inspection or non-egress hooks. Those are possible future extensions, not part of this contract.
- **Constraining or sandboxing the middleware itself.** A middleware gets raw access to request content. OpenShell routes payloads to a service the operator chose to trust; it does not sandbox the middleware, verify its behavior, or prevent a malicious one from mishandling the data it inspects. Initially, trust is the operator's responsibility, the same way it is for sandbox images. Stronger guarantees, such as mutual authentication between the supervisor and the middleware or running the middleware in its own sandbox, will follow but are out of scope here.
- **Runtime management of middleware.** Middleware is declared in gateway configuration. A runtime CLI or API to add, list, or validate middleware is deferred.
- **Guaranteeing detection correctness.** OpenShell places the hook and enforces the decision the middleware returns, but it does not guarantee that a middleware actually catches all sensitive content. Detection quality is the middleware's responsibility.
- **Support for multiple deployment modes.** The first version commits to a single deployment shape: an externally managed middleware service. Other shapes such as WASM middleware, OpenShell-managed images, sidecars, and running the middleware inside its own sandbox are not designed in this RFC. They remain explicitly open for later evaluation rather than being baked into the initial contract. See [appendices/deployment-options.md](appendices/deployment-options.md).

## Proposal

The first version makes egress middleware concrete without prematurely standardizing every future deployment model. The chosen path is an externally managed middleware service: the operator runs the service, OpenShell routes selected egress through it, and the middleware returns a decision plus optional transformed content and metadata. This keeps the first iteration focused on the contract, failure behavior, and sandbox integration while leaving other deployment shapes open (see [appendices/deployment-options.md](appendices/deployment-options.md)).

### Architecture

Three components participate:

- **Gateway (control plane).** Registers middleware, validates that each registered service supports the policies that reference it, and distributes the effective middleware configuration to supervisors. The gateway never sees live request bodies; it stays off the hot path.
- **Supervisor proxy (data plane).** Calls the middleware on the request hot path, enforces the returned decision, forwards only the content the middleware returns, and carries emitted metadata forward. The supervisor owns the upstream call.
- **Middleware service.** An operator-run service, reachable from supervisors over gRPC, that inspects the request and returns a decision, optional transformed content, findings, and metadata. It owns all detection and transformation logic and never makes the upstream call itself.

    SUP -->|"request content + context"| MW
    MW -->|"decision + transformed<br/>content + metadata"| SUP
    SUP -->|"forwards allowed request"| UP
```

### Hooks and placement

A middleware service provides hook implementations that the supervisor invokes at defined points in the proxy flow. This version defines a single hook, `request.before_upstream`, and is structured so more hooks can be added later. The supervisor invokes the hook after network and L7 policy have allowed the request and before OpenShell injects upstream credentials or forwards the request.

```mermaid
graph LR
    REQ["Sandbox request"] --> L4["Network / L4 policy"]
    L4 --> SSRF["SSRF checks"]
    SSRF --> L7["L7 policy"]
    L7 --> HOOK["request.before_upstream<br/>(middleware)"]
    HOOK -->|"deny"| DENY["Request denied"]
    HOOK -->|"allow + transformed content"| ROUTE["Routing"]
    ROUTE --> CRED["Credential injection"]
    CRED --> UP["Upstream forwarding"]
```

This ordering is deliberate:

- Network and L7 policy run first, so OpenShell never sends already-denied traffic to a middleware service.
- Middleware runs before credential injection, so a middleware never receives OpenShell-managed upstream credentials.
- Routing runs after the hook, so route selection (for example, choosing a model for a logical endpoint such as `inference.local`) can use metadata the middleware emitted.
- The upstream call stays owned by the supervisor, never the middleware.

The hook operates on a parsed L7 request, so it runs only on traffic OpenShell introspects at L7 (HTTP today). Opaque TCP or TLS passthrough carries no parsed request for a middleware to act on and is outside the scope of the hook. Because OpenShell fails closed when a required middleware cannot process a request, attaching middleware to traffic implies that traffic must be L7-introspected; this RFC may require that explicitly so a policy cannot silently bypass a middleware by falling back to L4.

There is no request hook in the supervisor proxy today, so this is a net-new, synchronous, per-request call. Timeout and failure behavior are therefore load-bearing parts of the design rather than afterthoughts. The exact placement relative to credential handling, which is interleaved with L7 in the current relay path, is detailed in the pipeline-placement appendix. Other hook stages such as pre-policy classification, response inspection, and streaming message hooks are possible future extensions and are out of scope for v1.

### The middleware contract

The contract has two parts: a configuration-time handshake and a request-time hook.

Configuration-time:

- `GetCapabilities` initially, it reports the service identity and version, the hook stages it implements.
- `ValidateConfig` lets the service validate its own service-specific configuration fragment.

Request-time:

- A single hot-path RPC carries the request plus context: request identity, endpoint and header context, the bounded body, and the middleware's configuration from policy.
- The response is a decision OpenShell can apply directly: `allow` or `deny`, optional replacement content and allowed header mutations, findings (labels, counts, confidence, never raw matched values), and namespaced metadata.

The hot-path interface is gRPC. v1 may buffer bounded request bodies and use a unary call, with the contract shaped so streaming for large payloads can be added later without a breaking change. A baseline middleware ships in the supervisor and communicates over in-memory channel. The full request/response schema and capability fields live in the request/response-contract appendix.

### Registration and delivery

The operator registers middleware in the gateway configuration: each entry is a name and an endpoint. This preserves the trust boundary. The endpoint sees raw payloads and is operator-owned infrastructure, so declaring one is an administrative action, while policy authors can only reference middleware by a registered name rather than point traffic at an arbitrary endpoint. In single-player mode one person holds both roles, but the split still holds in shared deployments.

The portable transport is gRPC over TCP/TLS, reachable from every supervisor across Docker, Podman, VM, and Kubernetes drivers (Unix sockets are not, so they are not a baseline). A loopback endpoint such as `127.0.0.1:1234` is translated to `host.openshell.internal` so a supervisor can reach a service running on the gateway host.

```toml
[[openshell.proxy.middleware]]
name = "anonymizer"
grpc_endpoint = "https://127.0.0.1:1234"

[[openshell.proxy.middleware]]
name = "agent-traces-exporter"
grpc_endpoint = "https://127.0.0.1:1235"
```

Built-in middleware ships in the supervisor binary and needs no registration. Built-in names are prefixed `openshell-` (for example `openshell-secrets`), and that prefix is reserved so user-defined middleware cannot shadow it.

Supervisors receive the effective configuration over the same authenticated config path they already use for policy, provider, and inference config. Because the registered endpoint is reachable from both the gateway and the supervisors, capability validation runs at the gateway (at config load and when a policy references a middleware) and again at the supervisor before traffic flows; a validation failure fails the load rather than silently disabling the middleware. This gateway-side reachability is a property of the service deployment mode - a future sidecar mode would shift validation entirely to the supervisor.

### Policy integration

Policy decides which middleware runs for which traffic, how it is configured, and what happens on failure. To avoid duplicating the same rules across many endpoints, middleware is described once in a reusable layer that network endpoints then reference by name, rather than being repeated inline on every endpoint.

A middleware entry references a registered middleware (or a built-in by its `openshell-` name), supplies its service-specific configuration, sets failure behavior (`on_error`, fail-closed by default when processing is required), and selects which requests it applies to. OpenShell does not interpret the configuration; it passes it to the middleware and relies on `ValidateConfig` to check it.

Network endpoints attach one or more middleware as an ordered chain: each runs in turn, a later stage sees the previous stage's transformed content, a `deny` short-circuits the chain, and metadata accumulates in namespaced buckets. Policy validation combines OpenShell structural checks (the referenced middleware exists, the hook is supported, limits are in bounds, selectors are well-formed) with the service's own `ValidateConfig`. If validation fails, sandbox creation or policy update fails before any traffic reaches the hook. The concrete policy schema and its composition with the existing OPA/Rego evaluation live in the policy-integration appendix.

```yaml
network_middlewares:
  # Built-in secret redaction shipped in the supervisor; no gateway registration needed.
  - name: openshell-secrets
    config:
      secrets: redact
    on_error: deny
    requests:
      include: ["*.github.com"]
      exclude: ["graphql.github.com"]

  - name: anonymizer        # matches the gateway config entry
    config:
      pii: redact           # validated by the middleware via ValidateConfig
    on_error: deny
    requests:
      include: ["*"]        # applies to every request

  - name: agent-traces-exporter
    config:
      exclude_images: true
    on_error: allow

network_policies:
  github_api:
    # no middleware list: openshell-secrets and anonymizer both apply through their global selectors
    endpoints:
      - host: api.github.com
        port: 443
        protocol: rest
        access: read-only

  nv_inference:
    # anonymizer is global, but listing it here fixes its order before agent-traces-exporter
    middleware: [anonymizer, agent-traces-exporter]
    endpoints:
      - host: inference-api.nvidia.com
        port: 443
        protocol: rest
```

With this policy, `anonymizer` applies to every request through its global selector. Requests to `api.github.com` have secrets redacted and are then anonymized (both run via their global selectors, in `network_middlewares` order). Requests to `inference-api.nvidia.com` are anonymized and then exported to the trace collector: `anonymizer` is global, but listing it explicitly in the policy fixes its order ahead of `agent-traces-exporter`. If `anonymizer` times out or errors the request is denied; if `agent-traces-exporter` fails the request is allowed through.

### Middleware ordering

When more than one middleware applies to a request, the order is well-defined:

- Middleware are defined once in a top-level `network_middlewares` list and attached to traffic from network policies through an explicit `middleware: [...]` list. That list determines the relative order of the middleware it names.
- A middleware can also include itself globally through its own request selector (for example `include: ["*"]`), independent of any policy attachment. Globally-included middleware run *before* the policy-attached list, in the order they appear in `network_middlewares`.
- A middleware runs at most once per request. If the same middleware is both globally included and named in a policy's list (or listed more than once), it executes a single time, at the position given by the policy list.

For example, if `openshell-secrets` includes `*.github.com` globally and the policy for `api.github.com` attaches `middleware: [anonymizer]`, a request to `api.github.com` runs `openshell-secrets` first (global), then `anonymizer` (policy list).

### Metadata and downstream routing

Beyond allow/deny and transformation, middleware emits namespaced metadata (for example `request.modalities`, `privacy.sensitivity`, `privacy.requires_local_model`) into a request-local metadata bag. Metadata uses stable primitive types, never carries raw sensitive values, and is marked for where it may be used: audit, routing, or internal-only. This is the seam a future model router consumes; the router itself is out of scope ([#1734](https://github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/issues/1734)).

How metadata keys are namespaced to avoid collisions between middleware is left open. One natural option is to derive the namespace from the middleware name (for example `anonymizer.sensitivity`), which prevents conflicts without a central key registry. Because nothing consumes middleware metadata in v1, this RFC defers the exact namespacing scheme to the work that introduces a consumer.

### Audit and logging

A middleware decision is observable sandbox behavior, so it is recorded as an OCSF event, consistent with how the supervisor already logs network and L7 enforcement. This RFC commits to the event categories and the safety rules; exact field mappings live in the failure-and-audit appendix.

- **Per-request decisions** are `HttpActivity` events, since the middleware is an L7 enforcement point. Each invocation records the middleware name, the decision (`allow` or `deny`), whether content was transformed, latency, and the policy and endpoint context. Allowed requests are `Informational`; denials are `Medium`.
- **Failures that block traffic** dual-emit: the denial above plus a `DetectionFinding`, so operators can alert when a required middleware is unavailable, times out, returns a malformed response, or fails a capability check. The finding is `High`.
- **Configuration events** are `ConfigStateChange` events: middleware registration loaded, capability validation result, and policy validation outcome. A validation failure that fails the config load is recorded here.

These events must never leak the content they describe. The OCSF JSONL may be shipped to external systems, so:

- Raw request content, matched values, redacted spans, and service-config secrets are never logged.
- Events carry only safe summaries: middleware and policy names, decision, latency, finding labels and counts, and failure reason.

This mirrors the middleware response contract, which already forbids the service from returning raw matched values.

## Implementation plan

How do we get from here to there? Consider rollout strategy, backwards compatibility, and migration.

## Risks

Why should we *not* do this? What are the costs?

## Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior art

Calling an external service from a proxy to inspect, transform, or block in-flight traffic is well-established. The closest analogs:

- **Envoy `ext_proc` (External Processing).** The primary model for this RFC. Envoy streams request headers and body to an external gRPC service that can mutate the body (for example redaction), allow, or deny, and the proxy and the processing service scale independently. Our `request.before_upstream` hook is effectively a buffered, single-hook v1 of the same boundary, with the proto shaped to grow toward `ext_proc`-style streaming later.
- **Envoy `ext_authz` (External Authorization).** A narrower sibling: an external service returns an allow/deny decision per request. It validates the "delegate the per-request decision to an external service in the hot path" pattern, without the content-transformation half that this RFC needs.
- **ICAP (RFC 3507).** HTTP proxies offload content adaptation, virus scanning, DLP, and content filtering to external ICAP servers that can modify or block request/response content. It is the closest *functional* precedent for content-aware egress control. Two details map directly onto our design: ICAP supports **pipelining** multiple servers (our middleware chain) and a **content preview** of the first bytes before full processing (our bounded-body buffering). What we avoid is its dated, text-based wire protocol; gRPC gives us typed contracts and a path to streaming.
- **HashiCorp `go-plugin` (Terraform, Vault).** Third-party plugins run as separate processes and communicate with the core exclusively over gRPC. It shows a strictly typed gRPC contract is a robust way to manage cross-language third-party extensions, which informs our registration plus capability handshake (`GetCapabilities`, `ValidateConfig`).
- **Kubernetes CSI / KMS.** Vendor-specific integrations are offloaded to external gRPC services rather than compiled into the core. Same "core defines the contract; integrators implement it out-of-process" split we use for middleware.
- **Proxy-Wasm (Envoy/Istio Wasm filters).** In-process WebAssembly extensions with strong default-deny sandboxing and no IPC latency. Relevant to the future WASM deployment mode (see the deployment-options appendix); set aside for v1 because it is currently weak for GPU-backed or memory-heavy semantic guards.

## Open questions

What parts of the design are still TBD?
